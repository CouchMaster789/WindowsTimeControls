# WindowsTimeControls

Remote control webapp for the Windows Logon hours allowed options offered by Windows to control user logon times.

The idea is not so that it's foolproof as these installations are often easy to circumnavigate but IMHO as long as it's obfuscated sufficiently then all should be fine.

To Install:
  - coming soon!
